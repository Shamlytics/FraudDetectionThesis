# Fraud Detection in Automobile Insurance Using Machine Learning 🚀

## 📄 Thesis Overview
This repository contains my **Master's thesis** on detecting fraudulent automobile insurance claims using **machine learning techniques**. The study explores supervised learning models, anomaly detection, and predictive modeling to identify fraudulent claims.

## 📌 Thesis Details
- 🏫 **Institution:** University of Portsmouth  
- 🎓 **Degree:** MSc in Data Analytics  
- 📅 **Year:** 2022  


## 🔍 Research Objectives
- Identify fraudulent claims using machine learning models.
- Compare traditional rule-based fraud detection with ML-based approaches.
- Improve fraud detection accuracy using feature engineering and data preprocessing techniques.
- Analyze the impact of fraud detection models on insurance operations.

## 📊 Methods Used
- **Supervised Learning:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Unsupervised Learning:** K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN
- **Feature Engineering:** Policy details, customer demographics, vehicle data, and claim characteristics
- **Model Evaluation Metrics:** Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix
- **Imbalanced Data Handling:** SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), ADASYN, Undersampling

  ## 🎯 Key Contributions
- Developed a **fraud detection pipeline** combining feature engineering, machine learning models, and data preprocessing.
- Compared traditional **rule-based fraud detection** with **ML-driven approaches**.
- Evaluated **model fairness** to minimise false positives and false negatives.
- Addressed **class imbalance** in fraud datasets using **SMOTE and ADASYN**.

  ## 🛠️ Getting Started
To set up the project and run the models, install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
